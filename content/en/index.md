## RocketGraph backend
Let's build a Todos app using React and RocketGraph. To do this head over to [rocketgraph.io](https://rocketgraph.io/) and create an account. Now sign in to the dashboard and create a new project. It might take a while(4-5 mins) to create a new project. Please note that we spin up a new instance for each project to isolate processes. Your backend is ready!

Yes you heard that right! Your backend is completely configured with Postgres database with a postgres user and password. On top of that this is also connected to a Hasura Graphql engine and run our custom [Hasura Batteries](https://github.com/RocketsGraphQL/hasura-batteries) on top of this stack. [Hasura Batteries](https://github.com/RocketsGraphQL/hasura-batteries) provides authentication, payments (We will explore this later) and several other functionality right out of the box. So that you do not have to build it for your customers. We got it for you.
